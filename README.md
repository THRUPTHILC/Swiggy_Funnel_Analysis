**Project Overview: Swiggy Funnel Optimization Study**

In this comprehensive study, I delved into Swiggy's operational dynamics for the year 2019, leveraging the detailed data from the 'Funnel Analysis Dataset' workbook, which encompasses three critical sections. The project's objective was to extract pivotal insights and pinpoint areas for operational enhancement.

**Project Highlights and Accomplishments:**

**Order Dynamics Analysis:** I meticulously analyzed the variation in daily order volumes, completing the requisite fields in the 'Session Insights' section. Significant dates were identified where there was a notable increase or decrease in orders compared to the corresponding day of the previous week, shedding light on consumer patterns.

**Web Traffic Evaluation:** I conducted a detailed examination of web traffic alterations week-over-week, focusing on shifts in traffic origins through the 'Traffic Sources Overview' section. This exploration was crucial in decoding the underlying factors affecting user interactions.

**Conversion Rate Exploration:** Through an in-depth assessment of the overall conversion metrics and their subdivisions (L2M, M2C, C2P, P2O), I pinpointed areas of fluctuation. Subsequently, I developed hypotheses to account for these variations, considering the impact of diverse elements on customer decisions.

**Hypotheses Testing:** Leveraging the 'Additional Insights' data, I undertook a thorough validation of the proposed hypotheses, aiming to uncover the fundamental reasons behind shifts in conversion metrics.

The culmination of this project was the submission of an elaborate Funnel Analysis Report. This document not only encapsulated the key findings and insights but also provided reasoned explanations for the observed trends in order volumes, web traffic nuances, and conversion rate shifts.
